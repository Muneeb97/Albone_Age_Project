# Albone_Age_Project
Data Analysis of Albone age dataset and prediction of age using machine learning models.

Data processing and analysis has been done before moving to the ML part. Two approaches have been taken while working on this project. 

One, where the prediction variable (Age) has been taken as a continous value and Regression models have been used to predict the age based on the data. 

Two, where the mean age has been calculated and a conditon has been placed on the Age data where if the value of age is greater than the mean value, consider it 1, else 0. This made it acceptable to use Classification models.
